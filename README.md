# Math-Capstone
The goal of this project is to simulate a population using pygame.
It has attributes such as the days to recover, infection rate and others to compare different situations.
Multiple simulations are ran with these attributes and then the average at each time period of the number of suseptible, infected, and recovered cells are taken and then graphed.
